Anna is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the exams given during this semester.
Create a class named Student with the following specifications:
➢ An instance variable named scores holds a student's 5 exam scores.
➢ A void input () function reads 5 integers and saves them to scores.
➢ An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's
scores.
Input Format
In the void Student::input() function, you must read 5 scores from standard input and save them to your scores instance variable.
Output Format
In the int Student::calculateTotalScore() function, you must return the student's total grade (the sum of the values in scores).
The code in the editor will determine how many scores are larger than Anna’s and print that number to the console.
Sample Input
The first line contains n, the number of students in Anna’s class. The n subsequent lines contain each student's 5 exam grades for this semester.

SOURCE CODE:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class student{
private:
int arr[5];
public:
void student::input(){
    cout<<"Enter marks\n";
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        cin>>arr[i];
}
}
int student::calculatetotalscore(){
    int s=0;
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        s=s+arr[i];
    }
    return s;
}
};
int main()
{
    int anna=0, c=0;
    int n;
    cout<<"Enter n \n";
    cin>>n;
student s1[n];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    s1[i].input();
int z=s1[i].student::calculatetotalscore();
if(i==0){
 anna=z;
}
if(anna<z){
    c++;
}
}
cout<<c<<endl;
return 0;
}
